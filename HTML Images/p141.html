		<h1 align="center"> Width Attribute in  Img Element </h1>

		<p> <b> Tip: </b> It is a good practice to specify both the height and width attributes for an image. If these attributes are set, the space required for the image is reserved when the page is loaded. However, without these attributes, the browser does not know the size of the image, and cannot reserve the appropriate space to it. The effect will be that the page layout will change during loading (while the images load).</p>
